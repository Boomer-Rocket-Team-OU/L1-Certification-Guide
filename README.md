# L1-Certification-Guide
Repository dedicated to storing all relevant information towards attaining a Level 1 Certification with Tripoli Rocket Association (TRA) 

## Why do you need an L1 Certification?

Achieving a level 1 certification allows you to the ability to purchase and use class H- and class I- motors. Beyond the ability to purchase higher power motors, you also demonstrate competence and safety awarness - which is not only helpful for college, it looks extremely healthy on your resume. Furthermore demonstrating the ability to achieve an L1 compliant rocket, also grants insurance coverage. This means that should an accident occur, both you and TRA are non-liable. Lastly it builds the route to demonstrating even more advanced rockets, using even more powerful engines.

## Steps to getting an L1 Certification.

### Step 1: Clearing the age and membership requirement.
Right as the name implies you must be at least 18 years of age to be able to work towards an L1 certification (if your under 18 mb bro ðŸ’€). As far as the other requirment which is "be a student or senior member in good standing with the Tripoli Rocket Association". This requires the student in question to apply to tripoli as a member (20$ USD single time payment afaik). 

### Step 2: Design & Build Your Rocket
In this step, the essential requirement is for you to design and build your own airframe for the launch. Note that in the case of an L1 certification it is also okay to use a kit rocket (easily bought of amazon or third party distributors). Note that conventional rockets are the only ones that are allow for this - no strange designs (flying cats and dogs or whatever else). 

**YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FULLY 3D PRINT, YOU MAY ONLY 3D PRINT FINS**

### Step 3: Installing a Recovery System
For the sake of this project it is also a requirement to install a recovery system in the form of a parachute. Note that dual deployment is allowed. 

### Step 4: Motor Selection and Inspection
You are allowed the use of a **single** stage commercially certified H- or I- class rocket motor.

**Note you are not allowed to cluster or stage your certification flight**

### Step 5: Pre-Flight Documentation
A local authority (normally a Prefect, TAP member or a Tripoli Director) must verify the flight profile of your rocket - this is to ensure that your rocket is in compliance with local flight code as well as the FAA's FAR restrictions as noted in section 101 (part C amateur rockets from my recollection). 

- They will also perform a motor insepction, to eensure that your motor was properly attached to your assembly.
- There will also be a full rocket inspection pre-launch (checking your airframe and recovery system)

### Step 6: Certification Flight

Actually launching your rocket (Finally ðŸ˜­).

The authority presiding over your launch will be there to ensure that the rocket has a stable ascent and safe controlled descent. 

- This concludes with a recovery inspection, with the authority checking the structural damage. If your rocket can fly again after the landing YOU PASS! if not ðŸ˜¿ (very sad, try again later!)

## Locations to get an L1 Certification

Please refer to the Tripoli website for the nearest location that is quantified as a safe launch site. (note that most of these places are pretty far out and will take a couple hours of driving to get too! Save a weekend!)
